A1.1
LASER Printer

LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
It is a device that stimulates atoms or molecules to emit light at particular wavelengths and amplifies that light, typically producing a very narrow beam of radiation. The emission generally covers an extremely limited range of visible, infrared, or ultraviolet wavelengths.

Principle –

  Principle behind working of laser printer is static electricity. Since oppositely charged atoms are attracted to each other, object with opposite static electric field cling together

Working- 
	Printer controller receives page data. It reads the data and arranges the page accordingly and then orders the raster image processor to convert it into bitmap.
	Rolling photoreceptor drum is positively charged. Light photons incident on drum’s surface improve conductivity in that region to make it locally discharge in that area. 
	Laser draws an electrostatic image of page on photosensitive surface.
	Positively charged toner particles are embedded in negative region. Toner particles get embedded on drum right over electrostatic image of page.
	Paper passes over the drum to print image.The paper surface comes in contact with drum, only the positively charged toner particles stick to paper creating exact image.
	Paper is passed through hot Teflon coated rollers which melt plastic in toners, to make it stick.
 
Figure 1.1 represents the working of LASER printer

Advantages – 
	Laser can move very quickly so it can write with much great speed than ink jet.
	Laser beam has unifying diameter it can draw more precisely without spilling ink. 
     Disadvantages-
	Require more space.
	Costly than other printers.

CD-DRIVE

A drive that reads a compact disc and that is connected to an audio system. CD player - a stand-alone piece of electronic equipment that either has its own display or attaches to a television set. Drive is a device that writes data onto or reads data from a storage medium.

Working-

	Inside the CD player, there is a miniature laser beam and a small photoelectric cell. When we press play, an electric motor makes the disc rotate at high speed. The laser beam switches on and scans along a track, from the center of the CD to the outside. The motor slows the disc down gradually as the laser/photocell scans from the center to the outside of the disc.

	The laser flashes up onto the shiny side of the CD, bouncing off the pattern of pits  and lands  on the disc. The lands reflect the laser light straight back, while the pits scatter the light.


	Every time the light reflects back, the photocell detects it and sends a burst of electric current to a circuit that generates the number one. When the light fails to reflect back, the photocell realizes there is no land and circuit generates the number zero. Thus the scanning laser and electronic circuit gradually recreates the pattern of zeros and ones that were originally stored on the disc in the factory. Another electronic circuit in the CD player decodes these binary numbers and converts them back into a changing pattern of electric currents.

	A loudspeaker transforms the electric currents into sounds which we hear.

From B2.2 , we see the Kinetic Energy is not conserved. It is evident that there is a huge loss of kinetic energy which means the collision of the bullet and door is inelastic collision. In inelastic collision, maximum kinetic energy is lost.

The laser beam switches on and scans along a track, from the center of the CD to the outside. The motor slows the disc down gradually as the laser/photocell scans from the center to the outside of the disc.

	The laser flashes up onto the shiny side of the CD, bouncing off the pattern of pits  and lands  on the disc. The lands reflect the laser light straight back, while the pits scatter the light.


	Every time the light reflects back, the photocell detects it and sends a burst of electric current to a circuit that generates the number one. When the light fails to reflect back, the photocell realizes there is no land and circuit generates the number zero. Thus the scanning laser and electronic circuit gradually recreates the pattern of zeros and ones that were originally stored on the disc in the factory. Another electronic circuit in the CD player decodes these binary numbers and converts them back into a changing pattern of electric currents.

	A loudspeaker transforms the electric currents into sounds which we hear.

PART B
Solution to B1
x=52 
y=7
Now, 
m= 2 + (x × 0.01 × y)				l= 0.540 + (0.03 × y)
m= 2 + (52 × 0.01 × 7)				l= 0.540 + (0.03 × 7)
m=2 + (3.64)					l= 0.540 + (0.21)
m= 5.64 kg					l= 0.75 m
B1.1
Ʈ = I × α
 α=Ʈ/I
	Ʈ=(m×g×(l/2) ) 
	Ʈ=(5.64×9.81×(0.75/2))
	Ʈ=20.748 Nm

	I=(m×l^2)/3
	I=(5.64×〖0.75〗^2)/3
	I=1.0575 kgm^2
α=20.748/1.0575
α=19.6198 rad/s^2 
Angular acceleration = 19.6198 rad/s2



B1.2
a = r × α
 r=l/2 m
r=0.375 m

From B1.1, α=19.6198 rad/s^2   
a = 0.375 × 19.6198
a=7.3574 m/s^2 
Linear acceleration = 7.3574 m/s2
Solution to B2
b(width) = 1 +( 0.01 × (x+y) )					M(mass)door = 15 + (0.01 × x) + (0.02 × y) kg
b = 1 + ( 0.01 × (52 + 7) )						Mdoor = 15 + (0.01 × 52) + (0.02 × 7)
b = 1 + ( 0.01 × 59 )						Mdoor = 15 + 0.52 + 0.14 
b = 1 + (0.59)							Mdoor = 15.66 kg
b= 1.59 m

mbullet = 10 × 10-3 kg 			vbullet = 400 m/s 	
mbullet = 10-2 kg
B2.1
Now apply Conservation of Linear Momentum,
P(linear momentum) = L(angular momentum)
Here, P(linear momentum) = m × v × r
          L(angular momentum)= I × Ѡ = {(M × b^2)/3+ (m × (b/2)^2 ) }× Ѡ
m × v×r = I × Ѡ
(m × v×r)/I= Ѡ
(     m × v ×b/2)/{(M × b^2)/3+ (m × (b/2)^2 ) } = Ѡ
3.18/13.203002= Ѡ
Ѡ=0.24085 rad/s
B2.2
Initial Kinetic Energy = KEinitial 
Final Kinetic Energy = KEfinal
KE initial = (m × v^2)/2
KE initial = (〖10〗^(-2)× 〖400〗^2)/2
KE initial =800 J

KE final=(I × Ѡ^2)/2
KE final=({(M × b^2)/3+ (m × (b/2)^2 ) }× Ѡ^2)/2
KE final=(13.203002× 〖0.24085〗^2)/2
KE final=0.38294 J
B2.3
From B2.2 , we see the Kinetic Energy is not conserved. It is evident that there is a huge loss of kinetic energy which means the collision of the bullet and door is inelastic collision. In inelastic collision, maximum kinetic energy is lost.
